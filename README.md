2. Research Interests
    Particularly, I am interested in *the sociology of scientific knowledge*, such as the interplay between scientific knowledge and social context, and international researcher mobility. What motivates me to apply for a master in Uchi is its Knowledge Lab. I would like to try my best and be a member of it, where I can explore advanced research methods and deepen my knowlege in the research field.

3. Personal Life
    In my spare time, I enjoy *reading, playing video games, and coffee brewing*. I also have a cat, **Mimi**. She is a domestic short hair and will become one year old in a few days. Though a bit shy, she is very nice and friendly.

## Summary and Reflection

1. Workflow
    Git init: initialize a new git repository
    Git clone: create a copy of the existing Git repository
    Git pull: fetch and integrate the changes from the remote repository before pushing my changes
    Git add: stage changes in my working directory for the next commit
    Git commit: save the changes I've staged into the Git repository's history 
    Git push: upload my local commits to the existing Git repository

2. Experience with Markdown
    # text: header
    \# text: display plain text
    *text*: italicize
    **text**: bold
    ***text***: italicize and bold
    ![Alt text](image_url): include images in Readme file
    [Link Text](URL): include links in Readme file

    If other people make changes to the remote repository, I need to use **git pull** to merge those changes before pushing my local file.
